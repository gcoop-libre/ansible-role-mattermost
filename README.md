### Mattermost settings

The config file template packaged with the role is very generic and only some
basic settings can be configured with the role variables.

If that's not enough you can replace the default template with your own:

* create a `templates` directory at the same level as your playbook
* create a `templates/myconfig.json.j2` file (don't use the name of the default template, `default_config_template.json.j2`)
* set the `mattermost_config_file_template` to `myconfig.json.j2` or the name of your file

If you use the default template you can use the following variables to change
some basic settings.

```yaml
mattermost_url: https://mattermost.example.com
```

The mattermost url.

```yaml
mattermost_site_name: ""
```

The site name.

mattermost_brand_text: ""
```

```

```yaml
mattermost_smtp_user: no-reply@example.com
mattermost_smtp_password: secret
mattermost_smtp_server: smtp.example.com
mattermost_smtp_port: 587
mattermost_smtp_security: STARTTLS
